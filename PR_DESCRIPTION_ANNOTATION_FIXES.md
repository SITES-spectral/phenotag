# Fix Persistent Annotation Loading Issues

## Summary

This PR fixes persistent issues where annotations were not being loaded or displayed correctly. Users had reported that even though annotations were being saved (visible in the calendar view), they weren't being loaded properly when selecting a day or image.

## Key Changes

1. **Robust Annotation Loading**
   - Implemented day-specific annotation tracking with dedicated session state keys
   - Added aggressive clearing of stale annotations before loading new ones
   - Created a fast filename-to-path lookup map for efficient matching
   - Added verification steps to confirm annotations were actually loaded

2. **Self-Healing Annotation Panel**
   - Added detection of missing annotations that should exist
   - Implemented automatic reload if annotations file exists but isn't loaded in memory
   - Added detailed logging to track annotation loading/saving process

3. **Accurate Image Counting**
   - Fixed the issue where saving showed the wrong number of images
   - Added day-specific filtering when counting images during save
   - Improved the logging of expected vs. actual image counts

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Updated annotation documentation with critical implementation notes
   - Highlighted key implementation patterns that must be preserved
   - Added debugging guidance for future development

## Testing

The changes have been tested extensively with:
- Days having multiple annotated images
- Switching between days with different annotation states
- Toggle operations for ROI overlays
- Various save/load scenarios

## Breaking Changes

None. These changes are fully backward compatible and maintain the same user experience while fixing the underlying issues.

## Additional Notes

This PR addresses issues that have been recurring even after previous fixes. The new implementation provides a more robust and resilient annotation system with multiple redundancy mechanisms to ensure annotations are always properly loaded and displayed.

The documentation has been expanded to ensure future developers understand these critical implementation patterns and maintain them during future changes.
