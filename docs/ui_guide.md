# PhenoTag UI Guide

This document provides a guide to the PhenoTag user interface, explaining its components and features.

## Overview

PhenoTag uses Streamlit to provide a modern, responsive web interface for annotating phenocam images. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear labeling and helpful tooltips.

## Interface Structure

The PhenoTag interface is divided into two main sections:
