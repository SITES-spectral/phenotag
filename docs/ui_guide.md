# PhenoTag UI Guide

This document provides a guide to the PhenoTag user interface, explaining its components and features.

## Overview

PhenoTag uses Streamlit to provide a modern, responsive web interface for annotating phenocam images. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear labeling and helpful tooltips.

## Interface Structure

The PhenoTag interface is divided into two main sections:
1. **Sidebar** - Contains station/instrument selection and configuration options
2. **Main Content Area** - Displays the selected data and annotation tools

### Sidebar

The sidebar contains the following elements:

- **Title and Caption** - Identifies the application
- **Station Selection** - Dropdown for selecting a monitoring station
- **Instrument Selection** - Dropdown for selecting a phenocam at the chosen station
- **Configuration Panel** - Expandable section for setting up the application
  - Data Directory: Input field for the root data directory
  - Session Management: Buttons for saving and resetting the session
  - Image Scanner: Tools for scanning for images

### Main Content Area

The main content area is organized into a two-column layout:

- **Left Column** (Image Selection):
  - Image selection radio buttons
  - ROI overlay toggle
  - ROI legend (when overlays are enabled)
  - Annotation panel with "No annotation needed" button and popup interface

- **Right Column** (Image Display):
  - Selected image with full detail and optional ROI overlays
  - Annotation summary table
  - Annotation metrics

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
